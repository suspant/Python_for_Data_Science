While Python has excellent capabilities for data manipulation and data preparation, pandas adds data analysis and modeling tools so that users can perform entire data science workflows. Python with Pandas is used in a wide range of fields including academic and commercial domains including finance, economics, Statistics, analytics, etc.\n"
